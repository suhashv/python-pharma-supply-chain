# Pharma Supply Chain System using Smart Contracts

This project implements a blockchain-based supply chain management system for the pharmaceutical industry. The system ensures the security and integrity of the supply chain by preventing issues such as counterfeiting, diversion, and theft. The blockchain records transactions immutably and transparently, enabling efficient tracking and tracing of drugs from the point of manufacture to the point of consumption.

## Features

- **Immutable Ledger:** Records every transaction in the supply chain.
- **Enhanced Security:** Prevents fraud, counterfeiting, and other illegal activities.
- **Efficiency:** Reduces the time and resources needed to manage the supply chain.
- **Transparency:** Provides a transparent record of all transactions.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Library:** PyCryptodome (for cryptographic functions)

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- VS Code (or any other Python IDE) for running the code.
- Internet connection for installing the required Python libraries.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
